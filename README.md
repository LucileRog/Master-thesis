# Master-thesis

The notebook "Term-paper-LucileRog" is my term paper and contains the model, discussions and results. 

All the code is in this repo: the modules are in ```/src```, the tests in ```/test```, and the ```main.jl``` file can be filled
to run the modules. The ```/src``` folder also includes 2 modules that you can ignore: I am working on it for my master thesis 
but they are not working yet, hence they do not belong to this term paper.
